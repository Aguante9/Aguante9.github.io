                <br>

    <h2>What is Emotional Intelligence (EI) ?</h2>
    <p>
      Emotional Intelligence is the ability to manage both your own emotions and understand the emotions of people around you.
      Self-awareness, self-regulation, motivation, empathy and social skills are the five key elements of EI . 
    </p>
  
    <p>The concept, also known as emotional quotient or EQ, has gained wide acceptance.
       However, some psychologists argue that because EQ cannot be captured via psychometric tests like general intelligence, it lacks true explanatory power.

    </p>
      <br>
    <h2> How is EQ different to IQ</h2>
    
    <p>
EQ measures the aptitude for understanding and managing emotions, empathizing with others and building effective interpersonal relationships.
As for IQ , it measures cognitive abilities such as logical reasoning , problem solving and analytical skills.
<br>
Your EQ is your ability to perceive and understand your and others' emotions based on information like verbal and nonverbal cues.
And your IQ is your ability to learn, interpret, and process information to develop hard and soft skills.
<br>
Having balanced IQ and EQ offers unique advantages in various aspects of life, especially in professional settings.
   For example, in leadership roles, cognitive abilities need to be harmonized with effective communication and social skills.
</p>   

<br>
   <h2>Why is EQ important?</h2>
   <br>
    
    <p>
   Emotional intelligence is important in all kinds of situations. 
   Whether you're chatting with friends, working on a group project, or just trying to understand your feelings, having emotional intelligence can support you. 
   It's like a key that helps unlock better relationships, smoother conversations and a happier you.
Emotional intelligence can help you make friends, keep your cool, make smart choices, and feel good about yourself. It's also great for solving problems, whether they're big or small. 
With emotional intelligence, you're more likely to lead a happier, more connected, and more successful life.    </p>
