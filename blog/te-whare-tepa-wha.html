    <h2>What is it?</h2>
    <br>
   
<p>
Te Whare Tapa Wha is a model of the 4 dimensions of wellbeing developed by Ta Mason Durie in 1984 
to provide a Maori perspective on health.
<br>
The 4 dimensions are:<br> taha tinana (physical wellbeing)<br> taha hinengaro (mental wellbeing)<br>
taha wairua (spiritual wellbeing)<br> taha whanau (family wellbeing)
<br>
The wharenui has connections to the whenua (land, sea, natural world)
which forms the foundations for the four dimensions

<h3>My wellbeing plan </h3>
<br>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 158, 250);">Taha Wairua (spiritual wellbeing):</span><br> 
  One thing i would like to go outside and enjoy getting fresh air in my breaks. 
 I plan to meditate aswell with the breathing exercises.
</p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 158, 250);">Te Taha Hinengaro (mental wellbeing):</span><br> 
I plan to do my meditation before study and sometimes in between sessions in order to stay calm and focused.
Making sure i watch something funny sometime during the day to make me laugh as i think it is crucial to laugh everyday, it is good for the soul.
</p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 158, 250);">Te Taha Tinana (physical wellbeing):</span><br> 
I already go to the gym 3 - 4 times a week as i gained a lot of weight this year.
One of the most important aspects of the physical side is sleep, i plan to get enough rest everynight during the week.

</p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 158, 250);">Te Taha Whanau(family wellbeing):</span><br>
I plan to hang out with my friends at least once or twice per week.

</p>

                <h3 style="color:rgb(0, 255, 21); border-color: #8809ff;">Te Whare Tapa Whā: Are any of the walls of my whare in need of strengthening? How might I do this?</h3>
<br>
<p style="color: rgb(255, 158, 46);">
  After thinking about his for a long amount of time i have come to th conclusion that i do need to strengthen some of my walls of Te Whare.
  For example my family and social wellbeing is not getting as much attention as my mental/emotional wellbeing and my physical wellbeing.
  i have noticed that i have not been able to go out much or get together with my friends as i have been really busy and whenever i do have some time to myself
  i like to rest and sleep to try and recover properly for the next day or week. 
  <br>
  Right now i do not feel like im nurturing my relationships but i am also aware that this is a tough period and will not be going on forever, 
  so i need to focus on what i believe is a great opportunity given to me.
  <br>
  Whenever bootcamp slows down or the course itself becomes less demanding i will plan to go out more and meet up with my friends which i used to do before starting bootcamp.
   I also intend to reconnect with my family more once all the intese course work is done aswell .
</p>
<p style="color: rgb(255, 158, 46);">
  As for my other walls i think i have been doing really well specially in the physical wellbeing side of things, i have managed to stay active and go to the gym almost everyday, 
  i have mantained a good diet and not forced myself into bad eating habits just because of the time restrictions and i have also been stickiing to a somewhat strict sleeping schedule, i try to get 8 hours of sleep daily. 
  <br>
  My spiritual wellbeing has also been something im proud of as i have been going for lots of walks and spending some time with nature almost everyday, helping me with stress and connect with my spirituality.
  I try to carr out a good balance in life with work and destressing.
  <br>
  My Mental wellbeing is both good and bad, i do get spurs of bad feelings if i feel like there is something that i dont understand , this leads to fustration and sadness, but i feel like i have been handling my emotions really well lately.
  If i do have some unnecessary bad feelings, i like to work on it and process what i am feeling so i can uunderstand and give myself a better perspective on my feelings in order to help me fix the issue or problem.
  <br>
  I am also doing tech ins with Barbora and she has been helping me with my stress during the course, we talk about my feelings and how the human skills might be helping or she might suggest things i can do to help with stress.
  Listening to music while doing homework is another practise i have been doing to help with stress, i find it really helpful as whenver i get stuck or fustrated i can just put dwn the keyboard and enjoy something i like.
</p>
<br>               
 <h3 style="color:rgb(0, 255, 21); border-color: #8809ff;">What are some of my key needs at the moment and are there some strategies I could try for meeting these needs?</h3>
<br>
<p style="color: rgb(255, 158, 46);">My needs right now are not something that stands out to me a lot if i am honest.  I do wake up in the morning and feel tired for the first few hours but i feel that is normal, i am however getting enough sleep, i am making sure of that.
  i don't feel like my physical wellbeing is in bad shape at the moment and that is something that im proud of. 
<br>
  As for my social and spiritual wellbeings, i might not be going through my best time when it comes to these to aspects of my life but i feel like the bootcamp is almost at an end.
   I want to focus on finishing my studies and completing the course and right now i dont have the time to focus on my social wellbeing when i also work weekends. 
   <br>
   As for my spiritual wellbeing, i don't think i need any improvement as of now or at least i do not see any needs that need urgent care right now.
  I am aware of what is meaningful and important to me, i feel peaceful and grounded with myself.
</p>
<br>               
 <h3 style="color:rgb(0, 255, 21); border-color: #8809ff;">What does my stress profile look like? What does stress look like externally (how might others tell)?  What does it feel like internally (how might you know)? What do you need when you notice you are stressed?</h3>
        <br>
       <p style="color: rgb(255, 158, 46);">On the outside is very easy to describe, one of my tells is the fact that my eyes seem to wander around a lot sometimes losing focus of my surroundings. 
        My biggest issue with stress is my eczema around my arms and legs, whenever i feel stress coming, my arms and legs become itchy and i begin to scratch a lot more often.  These two things make it easy for others to tell if im stressed.
        <br>
        Internally is a little more difficult to tell, i think when it comes to being stressed inside i start to feel a little bit worried, sad , anxious and insecure.
        I also feel like i struggle to concentrate a little bit as i tend to have whatever is stressing me at the time in my mind popping up very often.
        <br>
        I guess something that might help when i feel stress is the feeling of reassurance, i feel like if i somehow understood that everything is going to be ok then maybe my symptoms of stress might slowly fade away.
         Hard to tell but i think that when i feel the stress coming , it might help to step away from the work and maybe go outisde for a walk in the sun, i am not sure if this would be effective but i am willing to try it.
       </p>
         <br>               
        <h3 style="color:rgb(0, 255, 21); border-color: #8809ff;">What’s a wellbeing experiment I can try over the next few weeks (this doesn’t have to be a grand time consuming gesture, it could be something small like taking a few deep breaths before opening your computer).</h3>
        <br>
       <p style="color: rgb(255, 158, 46);">
        One of the things that has been bothering me lately is how tired i feel the first few hours of the day.
         My plan for the next few weeks is to get up maybe 15 minutes earlier so that i have a shower in the morning in hopes that it might help me wake up and feel better during the morning period.
