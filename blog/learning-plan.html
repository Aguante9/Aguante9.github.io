                <h3>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h3>
                <br>
                
                <p>As of right now, i am not entirely sure what direction my journey will take.
                I have always liked the idea of working as a game developer but my mind is open at this point and i would not like to close the door on any other opportunities that might arise.
                I am really looking forward to seeing what kind of doors and options this will open up for me.

                </p>

                <h3>A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning.</h3>
             
                <br>
                <p>
                    I like to think of myself as someone who is determined to finish any assignment put in front of me,  once i know the task that needs to be carried out i tend to find a flow state which is very beneficial and effective. Another strength of mine would be my relaxed personality which brings me a few positives like not pacicking when something goes wrong or even lack of fear of being wrong, i like to ask questions and make sure im on the right track, sometimes i can be the person who asks that silly question not many others will ask due to fear of looking a little dim where as for me i prefer to make sure i know exactly what im doing and if that means i have to ask lots of questions then so be it.
                <br>
                    One thing that i need to work on is making sure i read and understand everything properly, sometimes i need to take my time and reassure myself that i am doing the correct tasks, i am working on this aspect of my study plan.

                </p>

                <h3>What skills (non-technical/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3>
               
                <br>
                <p>
                           The journaling aspect is something i would like to improve, i have never really implemented anything like this in my studies before.
                    I remember at uni writing notes and studying them if that counts, but i think journaling is a little more complex than that. Having to revise and re run what i have just learned by myself was somewhat new to me and im still in the developing stages of this skill.

                <h3>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:</h3>
             
                <br>
                <p>
                           The plan is to focus the harder and bigger workload at the beginning of the week so that when it comes towards the end of the week it won’t be all piled up.
                    As of the beginning of week 3 i will have the whole week to dedicate to the dev academy course. I will be looking at 8hrs per day + a little extra if needed.
                    <br>
                     Luckily for us we have a lot of help outlets in the course with lots of people willing to help which is something i plan to take advantage of when i need it.
                    When it comes to working with others, i have never had an issue with group activities as i like to and would say that i prefer to be in the group environment. 
                    <br>
                    I believe we all come from different backgrounds and upbringings and we have all picked up different sets of skills along the way and even if we have different learning paces we can all learn or abstract something from each other and maybe adapt it to our way of learning.
                    While working with people and groups my whole life i have learnt that a good path to succeed in connecting with a group is  having a good base of values.
                    Respect, Kindness and flexibility are my base for tackling any group activities.
                    Respecting every individual whether they are a student, a facilitator or community representatives.
                    <br>
                     Treating everyone with the respect you would like to be treated like.
                    Kindness and manners a free so its a great thing to excersise i believe, people already have enough stress in their life , the last thing they need is someone being rude and nasty to them. I like to prioritise the social aspect of things when working in a group,  if everyone feels comfortable and welcome the productivity and efficiency will be very good.
                    I used the term flexibility in the sense of keeping your mind flexible, always be open to listening to others’ perspectives and ideas. 
                    <br>
                    I love the idea of borrowed learning which is essentially everyone learning something from everyone else even if its only a small intake and to be able to practise borrowed learning you need to be open to others’ ideas of course.
                    Whenever things begin to build up and it gets a little tough i will try to take short breaks to clear my head and make sure to stay hydrated. There is also the discord help group which i will make sure to use if needed.

                <h3>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h3>
               
                <br>
                <p>When i find myself having a tough time or stuck, i will try to go through my notes and fix the issue on my own, however if that is not enough i will not hesitate to contact any of the facilitators on the discord public channels or even in private.

                <h3>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h3>
             
                <br>
                <p>
                    Respect first and foremost , i think it is essential for people to treat each other with respect regarless of each others’ position in the community. Guidance is another thing i expect from the Facilitation team, i have faith that these facilitators will teach us and push us to bring out the best version of ourselves during this coding journey.

                    I work night shift cleaning on weekends, therefore on fridays and saturdays i go to sleep in the afternoon and i get home around 8am. I have managed to get my sundays off too now from week 3 onwards i will not work sundays, giving me an extra day of availability for the course .
